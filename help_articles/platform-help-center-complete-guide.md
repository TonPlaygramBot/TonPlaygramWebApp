## Account and access
Use account recovery from the login screen when sign-in fails.
Always verify phone/email/Telegram account ownership before changing profile data.
If 2FA prompts keep looping, update the app, clear cache, then retry login.

## Wallets, payments, coins, and points
Coins are used for entries, boosts, and cosmetic game items.
Points are progression metrics used for ranking and season milestones.
For top-up issues, verify payment status and receipt before creating a support ticket.
For refund requests, follow the Refund Policy and provide transaction IDs.

## Matchmaking and lobbies
Queue quality depends on region, active game mode, and current player population.
If queues are long, switch to a nearby region and avoid strict filters.
Cross-platform behavior can differ between Android, iOS, and Web clients.

## Gameplay, rules, and fair play
Use game-specific rules for 8-ball, 9-ball, and snooker scoring/foul logic.
Report toxic behavior, collusion, or cheating through in-app reporting.
Fair-play actions are policy-driven and based on repeatable evidence.

## Voice commentary and PersonaPlex
Voice commentary can run in remote PersonaPlex mode or local preview mode.
Remote mode requires PERSONAPLEX_API_URL and PERSONAPLEX_API_KEY.
If remote synthesis is unavailable, use local device/browser TTS fallback and still play commentary text.
Players can pick voice locale and style from the voice catalog when available.

## Performance and connection troubleshooting
For lag/stutter: close background apps, check Wi-Fi stability, and lower graphics quality.
For disconnects: verify network permissions, VPN/proxy behavior, and device battery saver restrictions.
On Web, refresh the session and test with a modern browser version.

## Reporting bugs and giving feedback
Provide reproducible steps, expected result, actual result, platform, and app version.
Attach screenshots/video for UI or gameplay issues.
Tag whether the issue impacts commentary audio, gameplay mechanics, or account features.

## Tournaments and ranked play
Tournament eligibility can depend on region, level, and fair-play standing.
Tie-break logic and bracket progression follow event-specific rules.
Claim rewards from the event panel after bracket completion.

## Privacy, security, and limits
The help assistant uses only public documentation and cannot expose internal secrets.
Sensitive, abusive, or exfiltration requests are blocked by safety filters.
Rate limits apply to protect reliability for all players.
