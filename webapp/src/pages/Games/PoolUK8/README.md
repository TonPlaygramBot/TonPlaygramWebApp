# Pool UK 8-Ball 3D Arena

This variant reproduces the Pool Royal arena with the English pool table geometry. All lengths are converted from official millimetres to metres when constructing the Three.js scene.

## Table geometry
- **Playfield**: 1981 mm × 991 mm (7 ft).
- **Relative scale vs snooker**: X scale = 1981 / 3569 ≈ 0.555, Z scale = 991 / 1778 ≈ 0.558.
- **Pocket radius**: 60 mm visual mouth (scaled isotropically on X/Z with rail thickness preserved on Y).

## Balls
- **Diameter**: 50.8 mm (0.0508 m).
- **Set**: 7 yellow, 7 red, 1 black, cue ball.

## Rack layout
Standard UK 8-ball triangle with the black centred on the third row and colours alternating by row while keeping yellows on the apex and rear corners.
