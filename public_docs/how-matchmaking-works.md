## Basics
Matchmaking pairs players with similar visible rank and recent performance bands.

## Queue flow
1. Join a game mode queue.
2. The system looks for close skill and region matches first.
3. If wait time grows, matching tolerance expands gradually.

## Notes
- Connection quality is considered to reduce laggy matches.
- Repeated declines can increase your wait time.
